    <h2>How the process usually works</h2>
    <ol class="notice-list">
      <li><strong>Apply for the grant before you start work.</strong> Starting early = ineligible.</li>
      <li><strong>Inspection & approval.</strong> Staff verify your loss or proposed practice.</li>
      <li><strong>Do the work & document it.</strong> Save receipts, invoices, seed tags, labor logs, and take <strong>before & after photos</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Submit for reimbursement.</strong> Provide documentation; staff may re-inspect.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment/reimbursement.</strong> Typically 30‚Äì120 days after paperwork is accepted; some practices can take 6‚Äì12 months.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Covering upfront costs (bridge funding)</h2>
    <p class="meta">
      Most cost-share/rehab programs are <em>reimbursement</em> ‚Äî you pay first, then get paid back. Many producers use short-term operating credit or USDA loans until reimbursement. ‚ö†Ô∏è You may need to <strong>make loan payments before reimbursement arrives</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Loan timelines & sizes (typical)</h2>
    <ul class="notice-list">
      <li><strong>Microloans</strong>: up to $50,000 ‚Ä¢ ~30‚Äì60 days to process when complete ‚Ä¢ good for small fencing/water/seed jobs.</li>
      <li><strong>Direct Operating Loans</strong>: up to $400,000 ‚Ä¢ ~30‚Äì60 days when complete ‚Ä¢ fit for wells, ponds, larger EQIP items.</li>
      <li><strong>Guaranteed Loans</strong>: lender-based; cap ‚âà $2M+ ‚Ä¢ timeline depends on lender.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AGI Limit Example (How the $900,000 Rule Works)</h2>
    <div class="notice">
      <p>
        USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) programs have a general income cap: if your average income over 3 years is above <strong>$900,000</strong>, you may not qualify. There‚Äôs an exception if most of your income comes from farming, ranching, or forestry.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A rancher earns $1.2 million over 3 years. $950,000 is from cattle sales and $250,000 is from non-farm investments. Since over 75% of their income is from ranching, they can still qualify by filing form <strong>CCC-942</strong> at their FSA (Farm Service Agency) office. If most of their income had been non-farm, they would not be eligible.</p>

    <p class="meta">
      ‚úÖ <strong>Best sequence:</strong> Apply for the grant first. Once approved, line up a loan if needed.  
      ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>If grant but no loan:</strong> you may not be able to finish ‚Üí no reimbursement.  
      ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>If loan but no grant:</strong> you cover 100% of costs yourself.  
      ‚è≥ <strong>If you can‚Äôt complete the work:</strong> approval usually expires, no harm/no foul ‚Äî unless you took an <em>advance</em>, which must be repaid.

      <h2>Common Questions Farmers Ask</h2>
      <div class="qa">
        <h3>Can I get help if I lost hay or forage?</h3>

        <h3>What if one of my cows died?</h3>

        <h3>Can I get a USDA grant for fencing?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Programs like ECP and EQIP often cover fencing repair, replacement, or cross-fencing. These are reimbursements ‚Äî apply first, then get paid back after work is done.</p>

        <h3>Do I have to pay upfront?</h3>
        <p>Most programs are reimbursements. Farmers often use USDA Microloans or Operating Loans to cover costs until payment comes through.</p>
